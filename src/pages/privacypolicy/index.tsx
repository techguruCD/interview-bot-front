            <p>
              This section provides a clear overview of how we handle your
              personal data when you visit our Website. Persona data includes
              any information that can identify you as an individual.
            </p>
            <p>
              We take your privacy seriously. All personal data uploaded to our
              platform, including CVs and LinkedIn profiles, are stored securely
              using a third-party vector database service. By using our
              platform, you consent to the storage and processing of your data
              by this third-party service. We recommend that you review their
              privacy policy to understand how they manage and protect your
              data. There is no guarantee that this data will be stored in your
              own country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your data will be retained on our platform while your profile is
              active, after which it may be deleted. You have the right to
              request the deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.

              1.2 Data Collection on this Website
            </p>
            <p className="font-medium my-2">How do we collect your data?</p>
            <p className="font-medium my-2">
              Your data is collected in three ways:
            </p>
            <p>
              When you provide it to us, such as data entered during chatbot
              creation.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you upload it to your profile e.g. filling in profile
              details, allowing us to import those from LinkedIN or when you
              upload your CV.
            </p>
            <p>
              Automatically or with your consent when you visit the website
              through our IT systems. This includes technical data like internet
              browser, operating system, and time of page access. Data
              collection occurs automatically upon visiting this website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, when you interact with our AI chatbots, data is
              automatically collected from external language models, like
              OpenAI. Users of this website and all users who integrate one of
              our AI chatbots agree to the data collection and possible storage
              by these AI models. It is important to note that we cannot be held
              responsible for data processing by external AI models like OpenAI.
              Chatbot conversations with our chatbot are stored to improve the
              user experience, but only anonymized metadata is stored, and no
              personal data is collected. Users of our chatbot are responsible
              for not entering sensitive data.

              1.3 What do we use your data for?
            </p>
            <p>
              We record the details of your chat (the words typed in by either
              of you). Addition metadata is stored, which includes the
              user&apos;s IP address and related information, like estimated
              country, city, latitude/longitude, and preferred language of the
              chatbot user. If you choose to use this function, it is your
              responsibility to comply with applicable data protection
              regulations, and we assume no responsibility for the data you
              store. Some data is collected to ensure error-free provision of
              the website, while other data may be used to analyze user
              behavior. Our chatbot, operated by us, also stores chatbot
              conversations to improve our service. Please avoid entering
              sensitive data in our chatbot.

            <p>
              At our organization, we utilize artificial intelligence (AI)

              provide personalized experiences. However, it&apos;s important to
              acknowledge that the effective use of AI technology requires
              access to specific information, including data related to your
              interactions with our chatbots, such as text messages and other
              inputs. This data is used to train and improve the AI models.
            </p>

              Please be aware that engaging with our chatbots may involve the
              transfer and processing of personal data to OpenAI. The processing
              of your personal data by OpenAI adheres to OpenAI&apos;s privacy

            <p>
              OpenAI is a company headquartered in San Francisco, California,
              USA. When using the AI language models and chatbots provided by

              OpenAI is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and is

              including those applicable in Australia. However, it&apos;s
              essential to note that the storage and processing of your personal
              data at OpenAI occur in the USA, where data protection laws may
              not align with the same level of protection as in Australia. If
              you have concerns about the adequacy of your personal data
              protection, we recommend you carefully reconsider your consent
              before interacting with our chatbots.
