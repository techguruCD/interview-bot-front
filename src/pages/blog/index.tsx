                The productivity benefits of Generative AI can and likely will
                be applied across the whole economy, all at once. I feel like
                there’s a scrabble almost everywhere to make that happen. The
                problem is, it’s hard to believe that when individual workers
                are 40% more productive, managers won’t ‘cut’ some of the less
                useful team members they have – contributing to unemployment.

                While many jobs might be displaced, there are always
                opportunities and unfilled positions in the economy. The
                government knows what they are (they form a large part of the
                list of jobs we want migrants to do if they move to Australia.)
                Australia could mimic Germany’s approach to retraining those
                coal workers and, using Generative AI, do it at a much lower
                cost. They’d be using the technology that caused the problem, to
                fix it.

              <div className="mt-[1.5em] leading-[170%] text-[17px] font-normal">
                This article has referenced Generative AI because that’s what’s
                in the news but at some point, the same structural employment
                will happen with Van, Truck and Car Delivery Drivers. Estimates
                are that many of the 30% chunk of the economy which work in
                transport will also be displaced by AI (Self Driving Vehicles) –
                and need retraining. More generally, there are always some
                people unemployed who can benefit from targeted retraining. The
                businesses which need those trained staff would also support the
                scheme. It’s an unusual win / win / win.

                There’s more to the required government response than just
                training

              <div className="mt-[1.5em] leading-[170%] text-[17px] font-normal">
                The government has a lot on its hands and retraining displaced
                workers is only one piece of the pie. We may well also all
                benefit from authorities assisting Australian businesses in
                rolling out the benefits of forecast GDP growth. That sort of
                thing would help them to deliver the benefits of Generative AI
                productivity sooner. Again, as I’ve written about before, the
                benefits of AI are likely to flow to companies so we need an
                approach which ensures individuals get to keep at least some of
                those productivity gains they provide – another government
                responsibility in this situation.
